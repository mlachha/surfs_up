This data is comprised of 1517 entries. We can also see from the picture that:

1. The average temperature is 71.04 °
2. The minimum temperature is 56 °
3. The maximum temperature is 83 °

### Summary

the results prove that the weather is enjoyable most of the time on the island, so opening a surf shop would be a smart investment knowing that for most months of the year, there will be enjoyable temperature for people to come and use the surf shop.

* For additional analysis, we will look at the precipitation levels for the two months as well. The major takeaways from this analysis are:

1. The average precipitation is 0.136 inches in June
2. The average precipitation is 0.217 inches in December
3. 50% of days in both June and December have less than 0.03 inches of precipitation and 75% have less than 0.15 inches of precipitation
4. The maximum precipitation is 4.43 inches on a single day in June
5. The maximum precipitation is 6.42 inches on a single day in December

you can see the stats in the tables below:

By looking at our analysis result, we can clearly see that there is little amount of precipitation on a normal day, but we still have days with excessive rainfall. This goes to show that the surf shop will be able operate most of the days while a few heavy rain days will help keep the island ecosystem flourishing and inviting to people wanting to visit the surf shop.
